#README - Blockgraph Testing Team Take Home
Thank you for your interest in joining Blockgraph! Congratulations! You have passed the initial HR screening. The purpose of this take home is to evaluate your general engineering capabilities. 


##Instructions
This zip file includes the following sample data. Assume these are customers on the email list for Store1 and Store2.
* Store1.csv
* Store2.csv

We want to determine which customers that patronize both Alice's Aquariums and Bob's Books. The
list of customer's from Alice's Aquariums in Store1.csv and Bob's Books in Store2.csv. Customers
are uniquely identified by their first and last name, age, and state of residence. Each time a
customer patronizes a store an entry is added to the ledger in the store's csv file.
intersection of customers between Store1 and Store2. Specifically, 
* Create a function that takes in two distinct filenames as inputs. You may assume that these are
  always distinct.
* Determine which customers have patronized both stores and output them in a list.
* Customers are defined by first and last name, age, and state of residence. This means that your
  output list should be a list of Customer objects/structs/dictionaries with these four fields

Please include unit test cases. Use whatever programming language you feel comfortable with. 

##Deliverable
* Please include files related to the take home exercise in the same zip/tar.gz or otherwise compressed file.
* Considering your personal life and busy schedule, you will have 2-3 days to complete this exercise although there is no penalty for taking longer should you need to.

##Hints
* Please include a short summary of how your code works. (This is a test on documentation as well as engineering)
* Feel free to write as many helper functions as needed for easier testing and readability
* Assume that all input files will follow the same format as Store1.csv and Store2.csv. File format validation will not be required.
